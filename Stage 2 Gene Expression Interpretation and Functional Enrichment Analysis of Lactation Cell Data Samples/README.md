# **The Gene Expression Interpretation & Downstream Functional Enrichment Analysis of Lactation Cells**

## **Description**
This project is centered around the analysis of a pregnancy and lactation cells gene expression dataset. The project is split into two parts:
1. Interpretation of the gene expression data set using R
2. Functional enrichment analysis on the upregulated genes
3. Visualization of the functional enrichment analysis results

You will need the following packages on R:
1. gplots - Heatmap generation: 
2. dplyr - Data manipulation
3. ggplot2 - Functional enrichment analysis visualization

The following functional enrichment analysis tools can be used for this analysis
1. ShinyGO: http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/
2. GOrilla: https://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/
3. PANTHER: https://geneontology.org/
