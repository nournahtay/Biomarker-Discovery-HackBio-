### **Transcriptomics**

Author: Nour Nahtay (@nournahtay)

Transcriptomics is the comprehensive study of all RNA transcripts expressed throughout the organism. The field encompasses analyzing RNA types, their functions, and expression levels under varying conditions, all of which contribute to the uncovering of the molecular nature of disorders like cancer, thus enhancing diagnosis and paving the way for new therapeutic strategies. (Dong et. al. 2013)


### **Transcripts and Cancer: An Overview on Etiology and a Case Study**

Cancer is an inherently disruptive disorder due to its equally disruptive mechanisms and hallmarks. A key driver of oncogenesis is the alteration of gene expression. When the DNA repair system experiences impairments, the simplest of alterations give rise to abnormal growths manifesting itself as Cancer. (Dong et. al. 2013) Research has shown that RNA alterations play significant roles in various cancer subtypes, such as lung adenocarcinoma. For instance, a multi-omics study of two LUAD cohorts uncovered 3688 aberrant alternative splicing events, primarily involving alternative promoter and exon skips. These AASEs induce RNA dysregulation by disrupting binding protein, which contributes to tumor proliferation and metastasis. (Wu et. al. 2022)


### **Prominent Transcriptomics Techniques**

The introduction of Microarray in the 90’s has revolutionized transcriptomics by enabling simultaneous quantification of RNA using fluorescent DNA probes on microchips. This technology has been proven proficient in tumor mRNA research, offering insights into gene expression levels in molecular pathways and aids in biomarker discovery.

The technology’s main downside, however, is that differing methodologies can lead to differing results, which is why microarrays are verified by RT-PCR or immunohistochemical analysis. It also requires prior knowledge of the sequence of the probe, which is where the next key player comes in.


The introduction of the NGS technology in 2004 was a game changer in the omics field as it allowed for the seamless sequencing of whole genomes, exomes, RNA-seq and beyond without the tedious mundane work that came with sanger sequencing. The emergence of this technology led to a more high-throughput and precise gene expression analysis and also helped generate data on splicing variants, allelic expression, and RNA editing, covering major areas of transcriptomics with a higher accuracy and sensitivity in comparison to microarrays. (Supplitt, et. al 2022)

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, transcriptomics is a revolutionary omics branch that has played massive contributions to oncological research from biomarker discovery to oncogenesis insight to therapeutic targets and beyond. The revolutionization of pharmacogenomics and precision medicine ensures that transcriptomics will remain a powerful tool for years on end, and it has led to the emergence of innovative RNA-based techniques, such as the RNA interference technique, which has already made groundbreaking advances in cancer therapy and more to come.
